# My Personal JavaScript Study Plan

This repository documents my journey of learning modern JavaScript, focusing on both front-end web development essentials and concepts needed for full-stack interactions. The goal is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript programming and prepare for working with modern front-end frameworks and back-end APIs.
